# pps4-trace

Circuit to attempt to trace the address and data busses of the PPS-4 processor. the aim is to capture the ROM contents by sniffing the bus.
PPS-4 runs on -17V so circuit sits on 0V to -17v and divides down the inputs to 3V3.
PSU runs off PPS-4 supply

There's a few ROM image files I've managed to capture.
